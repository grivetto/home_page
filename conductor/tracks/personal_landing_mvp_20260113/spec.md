# Specification: Initialize Personal Landing Page MVP

## 1. Overview
Create a modern, responsive personal landing page using React and Vite. The page will feature a light blue theme, a professional bio, and a "Call to Action" (CTA) section. The existing automation scripts will be preserved, but the core focus is on the new React application.

## 2. Goals
- **Primary:** Deliver a functional, visually appealing personal landing page.
- **Secondary:** Ensure the development environment (Vite) allows for local preview.
- **Design:** Clean, modern, professional, "light blue" palette.

## 3. User Stories
- As a visitor, I want to see a clear, professional introduction (Bio) so I know who the person is.
- As a visitor, I want to see a "Call to Action" (e.g., Download Resume, Contact) so I can engage.
- As a visitor, I want the page to look good on my mobile device (Responsive).
- As a developer, I want to run the site locally to verify changes before deploying.

## 4. Functional Requirements

- Brief introductory text (the Bio).
- Styled with the primary light blue theme.

### 4.2. CTA Section
